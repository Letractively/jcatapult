#summary Creating a component

= Create a component =

Run the _make-project_ script that is located at _JCATAPULT_HOME/tools/makeproject_. You can add that directory to your path. This script has a simple help menu if you don't know how to use it. The syntax for creating a component is:

{{{
make-project create-component
}}}

After you answer the questions it asks, you should have a newly created component. This component can be built using the following command:

{{{
ant clean app
}}}

Once the component has been compiled, you can run the component inside Tomcat by executing the Tomcat scripts located in _target/tomcat/bin_ like this:

*Unix*
{{{
target/tomcat/bin/tomcat.sh run
}}}

*Windows*
{{{
target\tomcat\bin\tomcat.bat run
}}}

Now you should be able to access the newly created component in a browser via http://localhost:8080
