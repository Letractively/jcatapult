The jCatapult Database Manager (*dbmgr* for short) was built to help make managing your databases easier.  It accomplishes this by managing creation, seeding, and patching of your project databases for you.

The dbmgr is coupled tightly with hibernate and, therefore, should only be used if you're using hibernate as your ORM framework of choice.
