#summary The jCatapult Database Manager handles all creation, seeding, and patching of jCatapult project databases.

= Introduction =

The jCatapult Database Manager (*dbmgr* for short) was built to help make managing your databases easier.  It accomplishes this by managing creation, seeding, and patching of your project databases for you.

The dbmgr is coupled tightly with hibernate and, therefore, should only be used if you're using hibernate as your ORM framework of choice.

*NOTE:  Be aware that sql seed files are case-insensitive on windows and mac and case-sensitive on unix.  This means that if you refer to a table name within sql, you must specify the exact table name that was created in the database in order for proper execution across multiple platforms.
