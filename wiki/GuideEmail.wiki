= JCatapult Email Library (JCEL) =

Built on [http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/ FreeMarker] and [http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/ JavaMail], the JCatapult Email library (JCEL for short) provides a set of APIs to easily create and send emails from an application. JCEL is designed primarily around two main interface APIs:

  * Email Service - Builds the email
  * Email Transport Service - Sends the mail

= Email Service =
The Email Service is an interface that is used to construct emails in a simple and templatized manner.  The API itself consists of one method, `sendEmail`, the javadoc for which has been pasted below for illustration:

{{{
    /**
     * Called to build the email using the specified template as the email body, configure the
     * email using the returned {@link EmailCommand} object and then send the email using the returned
     * {@link EmailCommand} object.
     *
     * Here's an example using the template below named 'hello':
     *
     * <pre>
     * Hello ${name},
     *
     * Thanks for buying all that cool stuff.
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>
     * You would call this method like this:
     * </p>
     *
     * <pre>
     * sendEmail("hello").withTemplateParam("name", "Joe Blow").to("joe@blow.com").from("info@example.com").now();
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param   template (Required) The name of the template. The implementation will dictate the type
     *          of template and how they are stored.
     * @return  The name value pair chain.
     * @throws JCatapultEmailException Runtime exception thrown if the from and/or subject are null and also
     * if the email message contains zero recipients
     */
    EmailCommand sendEmail(String template) throws JCatapultEmailException ;
}}}

== Email Command ==
As indicated above, the `sendEmail` method returns an `EmailCommand` object.  The `EmailCommand` API attempts to conceptualize email construction through semantics by giving commands (calling methods) that make sense.

Example:
Maybe you want to send an email to john@doe.com and have it be from 'jane@doe.com' and you want to send the email now.  Using the `EmailService` interface, you'd construct this email using the `sendEmail` method by issuing commands via the `EmailCommand` API as follows:

{{{
sendEmail("hello").to("john@doe.com").from("jane@doe.com").now();
}}}


For your convenience, JCEL provides a default implementation of the `EmailCommand` interface, which is dependency injected automatically for you (you can read more about JCatapult Dependency Injection implementation [GuideDependencyInjection here]) 


== FreeMarker Email Service ==
As suggested by the name, the `FreeMarkerEmailService` is an implementation of the `EmailService` that uses the FreeMarker templating engine to build the body of the emails.

=== Configuration ===
The `FreemarkerEmailService` uses [GuideConfiguration JCatapult Configuration] for configuring both the FreeMarker Template and Email processing behaviour.

==== FreeMarker Template Processing =====
There are a number of configuration parameters that can be specified to control the behavior of how the `FreeMarkerEmailService` processes templates. Specifically, these include:

  * jcatapult.email.templates.location:
    * Description: The location on disk of the FreeMarker email templates. This only works when the web application is deployed in exploded form. Otherwise the FreeMarker templates are searched for via the classpath.
    * Optional: Yes
    * default value: /WEB-INF/email
  
  * jcatapult.email.templates.cache
    * Description: A boolean that determines if the email templates should be cached by FreeMarker.
    * Optional: Yes
    * Default: false
  
  * jcatapult.email.templates.check-interval
    * Description: The number of seconds to check if the FreeMarker template has been modified. If caching is turned off this value is ignored.
    * Optional: Yes
    * Default: 2 if caching

To override the defaults, you would include these in your webapp's configuration files.  An example has been provided below for illustration purposes:

{{{
<config>
  <jcatapult>
    <email>
      <templates>
        <location>/WEB-INF/email-templates/sweepstakes/2008</location>
        <cache>true</cache>
        <check-interval>3600</check-interval>
      </templates>
    </email>
  </jcatapult>
</config>
}}}

The above example configures the `FreeMarkerEmailService` to load the email templates from the directory location `/WEB-INF/email-templates/sweepstakes/2008` and cache the templates in memory for 1 hour (3600 seconds).

=====Loading Template Files=====
The template files themselves represent the body of the email message and, by default, are loaded from the `WEB-INF/email` directory (this default value is actually configured within the jcatapult-default.properties file, which is contained within the jcatapult-core jar). Moreover, as mentioned above, this value can be overridden by adding the following configuration param to the webapp configuration files:

{{{
<config>
  <jcatapult>
    <email>
      <templates>
        <location>/WEB-INF/email-templates/sweepstakes/2008</location>
      </templates>
    </email>
  </jcatapult>
</config>
}}}

In order for the `FreeMarkerEmailService` to actually find your files in the configured location, the files must conform to the following naming convention format:

{{{
<template-name>-[html|text].ftl
}}}

  * <template-name>: arbitrary name given to the template (e.g. contact-us, sweepstakes, etc).
  * [html|text]: This token informs the service that the email message is a text or html email.

The `html` and `text` conventionally inform the `FreeMarkerEmailService` to send either a text or HTML email.  If both `text` and `html` template exist, then the service will use the html template as the default.

==== Email Processing ====
In addition to configuring how FreeMarker should process the templates, the `FreeMarkerEmailService` can also automatically set the email's from, from-display, to, bcc, and cc for you by getting configuration data from [GuideConfiguration JCatapult Configuration] files.  It accomplishes this by pulling configuration data using the template-name as follows:

  * jcatapult.email.<template-name>.from
  * jcatapult.email.<template-name>.from-display
  * jcatapult.email.<template-name>.to
  * jcatapult.email.<template-name>.cc
  * jcatapult.email.<template-name>.bcc

For instance, if my template-name is 'sweepstakes', the service will look for the from, from-display, to, cc, and bcc by trying to load the following from the configuration files:

  * jcatapult.email.sweepstakes.from
  * jcatapult.email.sweepstakes.from-display
  * jcatapult.email.sweepstakes.to
  * jcatapult.email.sweepstakes.cc
  * jcatapult.email.sweepstakes.bcc

= Examples =
To sum it all up, lets pretend that your website had a 2008 sweepstakes and the winner of your sweepstakes was john@doe.com and you want to notify them via email that they've won.

== Template Location ==
The first thing you'll want to do is figure out where you want to store your template files.  Since it's a '2008 sweepstakes' we'll store them in 'WEB-INF/email-templates/sweepstakes/2008' by configuring the location in the webapp config file as follows:

{{{
<config>
  <jcatapult>
    <email>
      <templates>
        <location>/WEB-INF/email-templates/sweepstakes/2008</location>
      </templates>
    </email>
  </jcatapult>
</config>
}}}

== Template Name ==
The next thing you'll want to do is come up with a name for your email template.  Since this email will contain details on winning the sweepstakes, lets called call choose 'you-won' as our template name.

== Creating Template Files ==
The first thing that you'll want to do is construct your email body and whether or not you want it to be a text or html email.
