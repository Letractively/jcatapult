#summary The JCatapult Ant release-svn plugin

= Introduction =

This plugin provides applications with the ability to create a release of a project and then publish the artifacts of the project to a remote repository for the other developers on the team to have access to.

This plugin contains two XML files:

|| *jar.xml* || Used for libraries and modules. ||
|| *webapp.xml* || Used for web applications. ||

One of these two files should be imported like this:

{{{
<import file="${ant.home}/plugins-jcatapult/release-svn/1.0/jar.xml"/>
or
<import file="${ant.home}/plugins-jcatapult/release-svn/1.0/webapp.xml"/>
}}}

This target is an interactive target that will assist in the release process. The documentation for doing JCatapult releases is contained in the [Releasing] documentation.
