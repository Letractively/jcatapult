#summary The JCatapult Ant junit plugin

= Introduction =

This plugin provides applications with the ability to run JUnit tests.

This plugin contains two different XML files:

|| *junit.xml* || Used for projects that require a database for testing. Usually modules and web applications. ||
|| *junit-no-db.xml* || Used for projects that don't require a database for testing. Usually libraries. ||

Only one of these two files needs to be imported like this:

{{{
<import file="${ant.home}/plugins-jcatapult/junit/1.0/junit.xml"/>
or
<import file="${ant.home}/plugins-jcatapult/junit/1.0/junit-no-db.xml"/>
}}}

= Targets =

The plugin provides these targets:

== test ==

Runs all of the tests, including unit and integration tests. This is done by calling _test-unit_ and then _test-integration_ in turn.

== test-unit ==

Runs all of the unit tests that are defined in the _src/java/test/unit_ directory.

== test-integration ==

Runs all of the integration tests that are defined in the _src/java/test/integration_ directory.


*NOTE:* All of the targets from this plugin take a parameter that allows a single unit test to be executed. This parameter is called *test* and can be used like this:

{{{
$ ant -Dtest=Foo test
}}}

This will only execute the tests defined in any class named FooTest regardless of the package.
