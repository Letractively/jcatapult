#summary The JCatapult Ant svn plugin

= Introduction =

This plugin supplies projects with a number of macros that facilitate the use of a SubVersion repository for source control of the project. Other plugins make use of the macros defined in this plugin for performing SubVersion operations such as check out, import, tagging (copy), etc.

This plugin contains a single XML file that should be imported like this:

{{{
<import file="${ant.home}/plugins-jcatapult/svn/1.0/svn.xml"/>
}}}

This plugin does not provide any targets.
