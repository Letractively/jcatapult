#summary The JCatapult Ant tomcat plugin

= Introduction =

This plugin provides applications with the ability to run web applications and modules inside Tomcat.

This plugin contains two different XML files:

|| *webapp-deploy.xml* || Used by web applications ||
|| *module-deploy.xml || Used by modules ||

Only one these XML files should be imported like this:

{{{
<import file="${ant.home}/plugins-jcatapult/tomcat/1.0/webapp-deploy.xml"/>
or
<import file="${ant.home}/plugins-jcatapult/tomcat/1.0/module-deploy.xml"/>
}}}

= Targets =

The plugin provides these targets:

== deploy-local ==

This target constructs a CATALINA_BASE directory inside the _target/tomcat_ directory. This will contain the necessary Tomcat configuration to run a Tomcat server. It also contains the a few helper scripts to run Tomcat from this location.

In order to setup the context correctly, the context configuration from the _deploy/tomcat/main/conf_ directory into the _target/tomcat_ directory. Tomcat requires that context configuration either be placed in the server.xml, context.xml or host based files. This plugin uses host based files. These are located in the _target/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost_ directory and since JCatapult doesn't use context paths the file is named _ROOT.xml_ so that it is in the root context path. Tomcat finds this file and loads up the web application and context configuration that it defines.
