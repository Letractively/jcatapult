#summary Creating a module

= Modules =

Modules are complete working sets of functionality that are able to be plugged into JCatapult web applications. Some examples of modules might include:

  * A news module for administration and publishing of news articles as well as RSS feeds and other news widgets
  * A complete blog system
  * A content management system
  * A user administration system

JCatapult modules are not like other Java framework modules such as JSF and Tapestry modules. These modules are more like widgets than modules. JCatapult modules are a complete collection of widgets and all the code that is required to use them. Examples of items that are added to modules are:

  * Entity classes
  * Services
  * Actions
  * Views (FreeMarker templates rather than JSPs)

JCatapult provides all of the support for adding modules to a web application including support for JPA configuration and much more. JCatapult also provides the ability to override views, services and other items from a module.

= Create a module =

Run the _make-project_ script that is located at _JCATAPULT_HOME/tools/makeproject_. You can add that directory to your path. This script has a simple help menu if you don't know how to use it. The syntax for creating a module is:

{{{
make-project module
}}}

After you answer the questions it asks, you should have a newly created module. This module can be built using the following command:

{{{
svnt clean app
}}}

Once the module has been compiled, you can run the module inside Tomcat by executing the Tomcat scripts located in _target/tomcat/bin_ like this:

*Unix*
{{{
target/tomcat/bin/tomcat.sh run
}}}

*Windows*
{{{
target\tomcat\bin\tomcat.bat run
}}}

Now you should be able to access the newly created module in a browser via http://localhost:8080

When you execute the `svnt app` command from above, these steps are taken:

  # Compile the code
  # JAR the project
  # Copy the project JARs into the _web/WEB-INF/lib_ directory
  # Copy the project dependencies using Savant into the _web/WEB-INF/lib_ directory
  # Copy additional configuration from _src/conf/main_ into _web/WEB-INF/classes_
  # Setup the Tomcat scripts and configuration into _target/tomcat_ (this is accomplished by Savant's Tomcat plugin)

After these steps have completed, the application is ready to be run. The Tomcat configuration is setup so that the web application is run directly from the _web_ directory of the project. This makes modifications to web application resources immediately available (such as JSP changes).

The `tomcat` script located in `target/tomcat/bin` takes a number of different commands that control how Tomcat is started. Here are the commands and their purpose:

|| *start* || Start Tomcat in a new process (fork in `*`nix). Output from Tomcat is directed to _target/tomcat/logs/catalina.out_ ||
|| *stop* || Shutdown a previously started Tomcat instance ||
|| *run* || Starts Tomcat in the current process. The output is displayed to stdout ||
|| *start jpda* || Starts Tomcat in debug mode ||
