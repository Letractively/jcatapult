#summary Creating a Web Application

= Web Applications =

At the core of JCatapult is support for building web applications. JCatapult provides a number of tools to make building Java web applications fast and simple. JCatapult web applications will normally consist of these types of classes and resources:

  * Entity classes
  * Services
  * Actions
  * Views (JSPs or FreeMarker templates)

= Create a web application =

Run the _make-project_ script that is located at _JCATAPULT_HOME/ant/tools/makeproject_. You can add that directory to your path. This script has a simple help menu if you don't know how to use it. The syntax for creating a webapp is:

{{{
make-project create-webapp
}}}

*NOTE: Linux and Mac users might be required to give execute permissions to the make-project script.  An example command has been given below that should appropriately set the execute flag for the user.

{{{
chmod u+x $JCATAPULT_HOME/ant/tools/makeproject/makeproject
}}}

After you answer the questions it asks, you should have a newly created web application. This webapp can be built using the following command:

{{{
ant clean app
}}}

Once the webapp has been compiled, you can run the webapp inside Tomcat by executing the Tomcat scripts located in _target/tomcat/bin_ like this:

*Unix*
{{{
target/tomcat/bin/tomcat.sh run
}}}

*Windows*
{{{
target\tomcat\bin\tomcat.bat run
}}}

Now you should be able to access the newly created webapp in a browser via http://localhost:8080
