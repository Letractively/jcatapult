#summary How to build JCatapult from source

= Introduction =

This document shows you how to build JCatapult modules and libraries from source.

= Layout = 

The layout for the JCatapult source repository is different than other projects at Google Code. Rather than containing just a single project, our repository contains many projects. Each project in turn contains the standard *trunk*, *branches* and *tags* sub-directories.  To get a list of the projects in the repository, issue this command:

{{{
svn list http://jcatapult.googlecode.com/svn
}}}

This will produce a list such as:

{{{
examples/
jcatapult-ant/
jcatapult-commerce/
jcatapult-core/
jcatapult-dbmgr/
jcatapult-doc-examples/
jcatapult-email/
jcatapult-filemgr/
jcatapult-scaffolder/
jcatapult-security/
jcatapult-webservices/
wiki/
}}}

= Checking out a project =

If you want to check out one of the JCatapult projects, determine which one you want to check out and then fetch the *trunk* of that project like this:

{{{
svn co http://jcatapult.googlecode.com/svn/jcatapult-core/trunk jcatapult-core
}}}

This will check out the project as read-only. If you are a committer, see below.

= Committers =

== Check out ==

Committers can check out projects and submit changes. The command to check out a project as a comitter is:

{{{
svn --username=<your-username> co https://jcatapult.googlecode.com/svn/jcatapult-core/trunk jcatapult-core
}}}

You will be prompted for your Google Code password.
