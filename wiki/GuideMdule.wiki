#summary Creating a module

= modules =

Modules are complete working sets of functionality that are able to be plugged into JCatapult web applications. Some examples of modules might include:

  * A news module for administration and publishing of news articles as well as RSS feeds and other news widgets
  * A complete blog system
  * A content management system
  * A user administration system

JCatapult modules are not like other Java framework modules such as JSF and Tapestry modules. These modules are more like widgets than modules. JCatapult modules are a complete collection of widgets and all the code that is required to use them. Examples of items that are added to modules are:

  * Entity classes
  * Services
  * Actions
  * Views (FreeMarker templates rather than JSPs)

JCatapult provides all of the support for adding modules to a web application including support for JPA configuration and much more. JCatapult also provides the ability to override views, services and other items from a module.

= Create a module =

Run the _make-project_ script that is located at _JCATAPULT_HOME/tools/makeproject_. You can add that directory to your path. This script has a simple help menu if you don't know how to use it. The syntax for creating a module is:

{{{
make-project create-module
}}}

After you answer the questions it asks, you should have a newly created module. This module can be built using the following command:

{{{
ant clean app
}}}

Once the module has been compiled, you can run the module inside Tomcat by executing the Tomcat scripts located in _target/tomcat/bin_ like this:

*Unix*
{{{
target/tomcat/bin/tomcat.sh run
}}}

*Windows*
{{{
target\tomcat\bin\tomcat.bat run
}}}

Now you should be able to access the newly created module in a browser via http://localhost:8080
