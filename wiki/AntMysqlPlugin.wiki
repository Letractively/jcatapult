#summary The JCatapult Ant mysql plugin

= Introduction =

This plugin provides applications with the ability to create main and testing databases.

This plugin contains a single XML file that should be imported like this:

{{{
<import file="${ant.home}/plugins-jcatapult/mysql/1.0/mysql.xml"/>
}}}

= Targets =

The plugin provides these targets:

== create-main-database ==

Creates a database named _${project.database}_, which defaults to the name of the project except that dashes are replaced with underscores like this:

{{{
foo-bar -> foo_bar
}}}

This target creates the database, grants privileges to a user named _dev_ with a password of _dev_ and then runs the JCatapult Database Migrator to setup the tables and data for the database.

== create-test-database ==

Creates a database named _${project.database}_test_, which defaults to the name of the project except that dashes are replaced with underscores like this:

{{{
foo-bar -> foo_bar
}}}

This target creates the database, grants privileges to a user named _dev_ with a password of _dev_ and then runs the JCatapult Database Migrator to setup the tables and data for the database.
