#summary The JCatapult Ant init plugin

= Introduction =

This plugin bootstraps projects and sets up all the properties that the other plugins require. If you want to change the layout of your project (not recommended or really supported), you'll need to create your own version of the init plugin. There are two files that this plugin provides:

|| *init.xml* || Used by web applications and libraries ||
|| *init-component.xml* || Used by components ||

This plugin does not provide any targets.

This plugin should only be imported using one of the two files like this:

{{{
<import file="${ant.home}/plugins-jcatapult/init/1.0/init.xml"/>
or 
<import file="${ant.home}/plugins-jcatapult/init/1.0/init-component.xml"/>
}}}
