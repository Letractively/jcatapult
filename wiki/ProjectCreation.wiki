#summary JCatapult project creation

= Introduction =

JCatapult projects are all created using the *makeproject* tool that is part of the JCatapult Ant build system. If you haven't already setup JCatapult Ant, you will need to follow the instructions in the [GettingStarted Getting started] document.

There are three types of projects that can be created with JCatapult:

  * Web application
  * Library
  * Component

If you are interested in learning more about the layout for each project type check out the [ProjectLayout Project layout] document.

Here are the commands used to create each of the projects:

*nix:
$ ant $ANT_HOME/tools-jcatapult/makeproject/build.xml create-webapp

Windows:
C:\> ant %ANT_HOME%\tools-jcatapult\makeproject\build.xml create-webapp
}}}


=== Library ===

{{{
*nix:
$ ant $ANT_HOME/tools-jcatapult/makeproject/build.xml create-library

Windows:
C:\> ant %ANT_HOME%\tools-jcatapult\makeproject\build.xml create-library
}}}
