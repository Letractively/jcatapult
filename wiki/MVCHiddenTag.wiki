#summary JCatapult MVC Hidden Tag

= Checkbox =

The *hidden* tag generates a hidden field.

= Association =

Hidden tags are often used to store values from properties in the action on the form. This is called client-side storage and avoids having to use the session. A common example is that you want to store the ID of an entity object you are editing as part of a CRUD.

The value of any hidden tag are sent to the server and used to populate the associated property in the action.

= Attributes =

The hidden tag supports all of the common HTML attributes that are covered in the [MVCForms forms] documentation. In addition to those attributes, the hidden tag also supports these attributes:

  * name - (String) The action property that is associated with the hidden tag and used to populate the value if the value attribute is not specified. This is useful for client-side storage
  * value - (String) The value of the hidden tag. If this is specified it overrides the value from the associated property

= Examples =

{{{
<!-- Generate a hidden field using the value from the associated property -->
[@jc.hidden name="user.id"/]

<!-- Generate a hidden field with a fixed value -->
[@jc.hidden name="user.id" value="2"/]
}}}
