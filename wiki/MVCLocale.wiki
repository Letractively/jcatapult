#summary JCatapult MVC Locale

= Locale =

JCatapult MVC provides a mechanism for setting and managing the current Locale that the user is in. This is done using a service that is part of the JCatapult-Core library called, `org.jcatapult.locale.LocaleStore`. 

This LocaleStore stores the Locale for the user in the session under a key of *jcatapultLocale*. This allows applications to allow individual users to select their Locale using a select box or some other mechanism and store it in the session for use across requests. 

The LocaleStore provides support for handling default Locale via the HttpServletRequest interface's *getLocale* method. This method checks to see if the user has selected a Locale in their browser and if they haven't, the system default is used.

The search order for the Locale via the LocaleStore is thus:

  # In the session under the *jcatapultLocale* key
  # From the HttpServletRequest

= Examples =

Here is a simple example of an action that might set the users Locale.

{{{
@Action
public class LocaleSelector {
  private final LocaleStore localeStore;

  public Locale localeUserSelected;

  @Inject
  public LocaleSelector(LocaleStore localeStore) {
    this.localeStore = localeStore;
  }

  public String execute() {
    localeStore.put(localeUserSelected);
    return "success";
  }
}
}}}
