#summary JCatapult Unit Testing

= Introduction =

JCatapult supports JUnit 3 and 4 for unit testing your code. We highly encourage you to unit test you code as much as possible. JCatapult requires that all unit tests for a project be placed into the _src/java/test/unit_ source directory.

Let's create a simple unit test for a class named Calculator. Here is the Calculator class:

_src/java/main/org/jcatapult/example/Calculator.java_
{{{
package com.example;

public class Calculator {
  private int one;
  private int two;

  public Calculator(int one, int two) {
    this.one = one;
    this.two = two;
  }
