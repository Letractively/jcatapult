#summary JCatapult Unit Testing

= Introduction =

JCatapult supports JUnit 3 and 4 for unit testing your code. We highly encourage you to unit test you code as much as possible. JCatapult requires that all unit tests for a project be placed into the _src/java/test/unit_ source directory.


= Test first or second =

Developers usually fall into two camps, the test first or test second schools of thought. JCatapult doesn't require you to use either one of these methodologies, but it is good practice to write unit tests at some point, whether it is first or second. JCatapult tries to make unit testing as simple as possible and thereby reducing the pain sometimes associated with unit testing.


= Project templates =

All of the project templates that are used by JCatapult during [ProjectCreation project creation] use JUnit 4.4 and the web application and module templates by default include EasyMock 2.2. These are dependencies that are defined in the Savant project.xml file and can be modified or easily removed from there.
