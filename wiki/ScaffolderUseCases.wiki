#summary The JCatapult Scaffolder use cases

= Introduction =

The JCatapult Scaffolder is aimed at providing functionality for the following use cases.

== List Scaffolders ==

The user should be able to list out all of the available scaffolders using the command line tool. This listing should be a short view with a minimal description. For example:

{{{
$ scaffold list
Here are the available scaffolders:

  foo - The foo scaffolder does some foo stuff
  bar - The bar scaffolder does some bar stuff
}}}

== Get Scaffolder Help ==

The user should be able to get help on a specific scaffolder. This help should provide detailed information about the questions the scaffolder will ask the user and what it will produce when successfully invoked. For example:

{{{
$ scaffold help foo
The foo scaffolder will ask the user the following questions:

  1. What's your name?
  2. What's your age?

Once the foo scaffolder has all of the information it needs it will produces some foo stuff.
}}}

== Invoke a Scaffolder ==

The user should be able to invoke a specific scaffolder from the command line. This will execute that specific scaffolder and let the scaffolder interact with the user. For example:

{{{
$ scaffold foo
What is your name?  Bob
What is your age?  32

Created some foo stuff.
}}}
