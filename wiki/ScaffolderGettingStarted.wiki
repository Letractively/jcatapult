#summary Getting started with the jCatapult Scaffolder.

= Introduction =

This documentation explains how to get the Scaffolder up and running in your project.  As of right now, these docs are written as of version 1.0-M1.  Until version 1.0 is released, assume these docs are milestone quality and are subject to change.

These docs also assume that you've gone through the [GettingStarted jCatapult Getting Started] documentation


= Details =
1.  Unfortunately, until we release a distribution of the jCatapult Scaffolder, you'll have to check out trunk from source control and build it locally.  Use the svn co script below as an example:
{{{
svn co http://jcatapult.googlecode.com/svn/jcatapult-scaffolder/trunk jcatapult-scaffolder-trunk
}}}

2. Once you check out the scaffolder, change directory to the jcatapult scaffolder project root and build the jar.  This assumes that you've gone through the [GettingStarted jCatapult Getting Started] documentation so if you haven't done that yet please do.
{{{
ant jar
}}}

3. Now that the project is built, change directory to the project you want to run a scaffolder on and execute the following command:
{{{
<scaffolder check out directory>/target/dist/bin/scaffold help
}}}

For example, if I checked out the scaffolder to '~/dev/jcatapult/jcatapult-scaffolder-trunk/' I'd execute the following command inside my jcatapult project:

{{{
~/dev/jcatapult/jcatapult-scaffolder-trunk/target/dist/bin/scaffold help
}}}

If you followed the above steps correctly, this should successfully display the help screen of the jCatapult Scaffolder.
