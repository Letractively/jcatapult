= JCatapult Deployment Manager =

As of 1.0-RC1, JCatapult ships with the JCatapult Deployment Manager (`deployer` for short), which is a deployment framework that uses Apache Commons Configuration, Java Secure CHannel (JSCH), and Groovy to provide an easy way to deploy webapps to remote environments.

= Setup =

This document assumes you have completed the instructions in the GettingStarted document.

The deployer comes with a Linux/Unix/Mac shell script and a Windows batch file that allow you to invoke the tool from the command-line. In order to use the tool, the deployer must be correctly installed and the executable must be in your path or must be executed using the fully-qualified location to the executable. The deployer installation is part of the JCatapult installation and is located in the _JCATAPULT_HOME/deployer_ directory. If you would like to add the deployer to your path, append this to your PATH environment variable:

*Windows*
{{{
%JCATAPULT_HOME%\deployer\bin
}}}

*Linux/Unix*
{{{
$JCATAPULT_HOME/deployer/bin
}}}

= Invoking =

To invoke the deployer, simply type:

{{{
scaffold help
}}}

This command will tell the deployer to display the help screen.

= Interactive =

The deployer tool is highly interactive in that it provides tab completion for ease of use.
