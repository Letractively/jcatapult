= JCatapult Deployment Manager =

As of 1.0-RC2, JCatapult ships with the JCatapult Deployment Manager (`deployer` for short), which is a deployment framework that uses Apache Commons Configuration, Java Secure CHannel (JSCH), and Groovy to provide an easy way to deploy webapps to remote servers.

= Setup =

(This document assumes you have completed the instructions in the GettingStarted document.)

The deployer comes with a Linux/Unix/Mac shell script and a Windows batch file that provides the capability to invoke the tool from the command-line. In order to use the tool, the deployer must be correctly installed and the executable must be in your path or must be executed using the fully-qualified location to the executable. The deployer installation is part of the JCatapult distribution and is located in the _JCATAPULT_HOME/deployer_ directory. If you would like to add the deployer to your path, append this to your PATH environment variable:

*Windows*
{{{
%JCATAPULT_HOME%\deployer\bin
}}}

*Linux/Unix*
{{{
$JCATAPULT_HOME/deployer/bin
}}}

= Invoking =

To invoke the deployer, simply type:

{{{
deploy help
}}}

This command will tell the deployer to display the help screen.

Both the batch and shell scripts assume that you are executing them from within your jcatapult project root directory.  If you do not execute them from within your jcatapult project root, then you will be prompted by an error screen informing you of such.

= Configuration =
To configure the deployer, there are 2 main concepts that you should be familiar with:

  * Domain
  * Environment

== Domain ==
The domain represents a server or group of servers where there are one or more environments where you host your web applications from.

== Environment ==
The environment represents a specific location within a domain where your web application is running from.  Each environment is uniquely identified by its name, which is an arbitrary value, however, suggested environment names are:  development, internal-qa, external-qa, staging, production.

Both the Domain and Environment information are configured via an xml file and, by convention, script execution expects the path of this configuration file to be relative to the project root at the following location:

{{{
deploy/remote/deploy.xml
}}}

An example deploy xml configuration file is included below:

{{{
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<deployment-configuration>
  <domain name="domain1">
    <environment name="internal-qa">
      <host>staging.jcatapult.org</host>
      <host-username>staging.host.username</host-username>
      <host-password>staging.host.password</host-password>
    </environment>
  </domain>
  <domain name="domain2">
    <environment name="external-qa">
      <host>qa.jcatapult.org</host>
      <host-username>qa.host.username</host-username>
      <host-password>qa.host.password</host-password>
    </environment>
    <environment name="staging">
      <host>staging.jcatapult.org</host>
      <host-username>staging.host.username</host-username>
      <host-password>staging.host.password</host-password>
    </environment>
  </domain>
  <domain name="domain3">
    <environment name="production">
      <host>production.jcatapult.org</host>
      <host-username>production.host.username</host-username>
      <host-password>production.host.password</host-password>
    </environment>
  </domain>
</deployment-configuration>
}}}

The deployment configuration schema is defined by one or more `domain` descriptors and each domain descriptor contains one or more `environment` descriptors.  The domain attribute 'name', environment attribute 'name', host, host-username, and host-password descriptors are all required fields.  The xml is validated so if you forget to define any of these fields the tool will notify you of such.

= Interactive =
The deployer tool is highly interactive in that it provides tab completion for ease of use.  Whenever you are asked a question by the deployer you can usually hit the tab key twice to get possible responses.

== Domain Option ==
The first question the deployer will ask is which domain you are deploying to.  These values are taken directly from the xml configuration file.

== Environment Options ==
Once you select your domain option, you will be asked for which environment within that domain you're deploying to.  Again, the environment options are taken directly from the xml configuration file.
