      This is a workaround for Tomcat sucking. Tomcat can't have a context.xml in the root of the
      conf dir because it then assumes that context-path is the directory name that the web app is
      running from. In our cases this would then always be /web, which sucks. So, instead I fake
      out Tomcat to think that there is only a single web application, the default installed by
      copying the context.xml file into the Engine/Host directory and calling it ROOT, which
      tomcat assumes is the default webapp.
