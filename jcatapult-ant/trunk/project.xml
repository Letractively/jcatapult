  <!--
    This workflow is only used when fetching this projects dependencies that are listed above.
    This works by iterating over the processes in the fetchWorkflow block until one of the
    processes finds the artifact. Once the artifact is found, then this calls ALL of the
    processes in the publishWorkflow block to store the file locally. This allows the file
    to be stored locally in multiple locations.

    The extra item entry fetches the source JARs for the artifacts.

  <!--
    This workflow is used after the project has created a releasable item such as a JAR file
    or a ZIP. After that file is created it can be "released" to a local Savant repository.
    This local Savant repository usually exists in the users home directory at .savant_repository.
    One thing to notice is that this workflow is used for publishing local artifacts that this
    project produces and they are placed into the same location as the publishWorkflow block
    from above uses. This allows other local projects to find the artifacts that this project
    releases locally.

  <!--
    This workflow is used after the project has created a releasable item such as a JAR file or
    a ZIP and the project has released that artifact locally using the publishWorkflow above.
    This workflow can then release the artifact to a central repository. This allows any
    developer to fetch the newly released artifact from the central repository for use in
    another project.
