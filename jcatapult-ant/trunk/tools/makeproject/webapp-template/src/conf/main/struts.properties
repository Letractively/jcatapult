### when set to true, Struts will act much more friendly for developers. This
### includes:
### - struts.i18n.reload = true
### - struts.configuration.xml.reload = true
### - raising various debug or ignorable problems to errors
###   For example: normally a request to foo.action?someUnknownField=true should
###                be ignored (given that any value can come from the web and it
###                should not be trusted). However, during development, it may be
###                useful to know when these errors are happening and be told of
###                them right away.
struts.devMode = true

### This option controls the default Struts tag library theme for the entire
### application. This can be modified or removed from here to better control
### the application's theme setup.
###
### NOTE: The default is the JCatapult semantic theme.
struts.ui.theme = semantic

### This option controls the default Struts XML reload strategy. Setting this
### to true causes some performance issues, so definitely turn it off before
### doing a release.
struts.configuration.xml.reload = false

### This has to be set here, otherwise any action configuration that is setup by
### the struts2-convention-plugin will use the default XWork package of
### convention-default rather than JCatapult's default. The JCatapult default
### XWork package must be used for JCatapult because it provides the enhanced
### parameters interceptor, which provides the ability to use type conversions
### that are more intelligent.
struts.convention.default.parent.package = jcatapult-default
