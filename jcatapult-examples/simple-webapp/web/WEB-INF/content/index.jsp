  Welcome to the JCatapult example web application. This web application contains two
  simple pieces of functionality. The first is a simple CRUD that manages guest book
  entries left by visitors. That is located at:
</p>
<p>
   <a href="/guest-book/">/guest-book/</a>
</p>
<p>
  The second part is a component that allows users to manage a list of sticky notes.
  This component is a JCatapult component and is completely contained within the
  JAR file of the component. The component is located at:
</p>
<p>
   <a href="/sticky-note/">/sticky-note/</a>
